# Java_Variables

A variable in java is data that can be store in a space of memory and that data value can change in any part of the program.

There are Types of data in Java: Primitive and Object.


### Primitive Type:

- Init  
- Float 
- String.


### Object Type: 

- Classes
- Interfaces
- Arrays


To give a name to a variable it mill start with a lower case letter example: "myVariable"
A variable that has been define inside the Main method can't be use outside of it.


## Definition of Var

The literal variables are of a only type.
After Java 10 this is not necesary , couse with var and the data type and the type is assigned by Java.

We can also use this opertator "+" between strings, to concat them.

### Example:
```
 System.out.println("myVariableString2 = " + myVariableString2);
```

The first one is the pure string and after the "+" is the variable that is defined before.

You need to be inside of a method too use var.


## Rules to Identify a variable in Java 

### Examples

```
"var 1MiVariable = 3;"    - not a statement  (a number can't be used to name a variable and special characters) 
 
var _MiVariable = 3;
        
var miVariable = 1;
        
var $miVariable = 0;
        
var Ã¡Variable = 2 ;  no recomendable

var #miVariable = 2; illegal character not allow  to user
```
